# Introduction to Algorithms
  ## Sectoin 1
    
- An Algorithm is a computional procedure that take some value or values as an **Input** and produce an **Output**
- Sorting is a fundemental operation in computer science
- The selection of a sorting algorithm depends on several factors:
    - Numbers of items being sorted
    - Possible restrictions on items value
    - The architecture of the computer
    - Kind of storage devices being used
- An algorithm said to be **correct** if it halts the correct output for every input sequence
- An algorithm said to be **incorrect** if it's not halting at all for some cases or halt with incorrect answer
- Incorrect algorithms can be useful if we controlled the error rate. 
- Data Structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modification
- Not a single data structure works for all purposes
